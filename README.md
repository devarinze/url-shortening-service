# URL Shortening Service
An application that allows users to seamlessly create short, concise, and business-friendly URLs from existing URLs that redirect to the exact same content on the web. It also supports the creation of URLs using customized aliases and keeps track of visits to the generated links.

**Directions for setting up:**
- Clone the backend and frontend repositories
- Create a database in PostgreSQL and ensure that the credentials (i.e. owner, database name, and password) are also in the application.properties file.
- Start the backend of this application to initialize tables. There is no need to run any additional scripts.
- Install the dependencies for the front end (run "npm install" in the terminal).
- Start the front end (run "ng serve" in the terminal)
- Create an account and you're ready to use the app.
